# OOP Project - Enemy Clicker Game

This is a simple 2D game built for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game is developed in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 

The game involves spawning enemies of different types, which the player can interact with by clicking on them to gain points. The game ends when the player's health reaches zero.
